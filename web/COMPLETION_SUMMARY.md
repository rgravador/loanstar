## 🔄 Business Logic Implementation

### Payment Application Logic:
```
Payment Amount
    ↓
1. Apply to Penalties (if any)
    ↓
2. Apply to Interest (from schedule)
    ↓
3. Apply to Principal
    ↓
Update: Loan Balance, Agent Earnings, Transaction Log
```

### Commission Calculation:
```
Interest Collected × Commission Rate = Commission Earned
→ Updates agent's total_earnings and collectible_earnings
```

### Penalty Calculation:
```
3% per month = 0.1% per day
Daily Penalty = (Due Amount × 0.03) / 30 × Days Overdue
```
