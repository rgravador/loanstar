## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### Module Not Found Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules .nuxt
npm install
```

### Supabase Connection Issues
- Check that `.env` credentials are correct
- Verify Supabase project is active
- Check that database tables were created successfully

### Login Not Working
- Verify `users_profile` table exists
- Check that auth trigger is working (should auto-create profile)
- Look at browser console for errors (F12)
