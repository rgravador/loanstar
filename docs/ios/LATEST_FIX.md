# ✅ Platform Version Error - FIXED!

## Issue
```
The package product 'Supabase' requires minimum platform version 10.15 
for the macOS platform, but this target supports 10.13
```

## Solution Applied
Updated `Package.swift` to include macOS 13 (Ventura) as a supported platform:

```swift
platforms: [
    .iOS(.v16),      // iOS 16+
    .macOS(.v13)     // macOS 13+ (Ventura)
],
```

## ✅ Status: FIXED

The error should now be resolved in Xcode. The package now properly declares:
- **iOS 16+** as the primary target (for iPhone/iPad)
- **macOS 13+** for compatibility (satisfies Supabase requirement)

## 🎯 What to Do Now in Xcode

### Option 1: Verify the Fix
1. Look at the Issues navigator (⌘5)
2. The platform version error should be gone ✅
3. You might see other warnings (normal)

### Option 2: Build the Package
1. Press **⌘B** (Product → Build)
2. Or press **⌘U** to run tests
3. Should build successfully now!

### Option 3: Create iOS App Project (Recommended)
